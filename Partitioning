Formatting SDCARD/USB/DISK using FDISK:

FAT32:

First run  fdisk -l to identify the correct drive.

Run the following in case the SD card is /dev/sda

umount /dev/sda

fdisk /dev/sda

Type d to remove the partition

Type n for a new partition

Type t to select partition type

Type b for FAT32

Type p to verify partition

Type w to write partition

Type mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1


NTFS:

First run  fdisk -l to identify the correct drive.

Run the following in case the SD card is /dev/sda

umount /dev/sda

fdisk /dev/sda

Type d to remove the partition

Type n for a new partition

Type t to select partition type

Type 7 for NTFS

Type a to make it bootable

Type p to verify partition

Type w to write partition

Type mkfs.ntfs -f /dev/sda1

NOTE:
If you have a large file system and dont want to wait hours to write zeroes through it, 
you can skip that part by running mkfs.ntfs -f /dev/sdx1 instead


PARTITIONING NOTES:

1. boot partition - 200 mb minimum - +200M plus on last sector
2. swap partition - 8-12 GB for 8GB memory (150%) - +12G on last sector
3. root partition - where you put all applications
4. home partition - personal files


# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdxx <---- boot, root and home partitions.
# mkswap /dev/sdxx <---- swap partition
# swapon /dev/sdxx <----- swap on

FOR EFI:

fdisk /dev/sdx
Command (m for help):g
Command (m for help):p
Command (m for help):n

set boot partition size

Command (m for help):t
Command (m for help):1

set other partition same as on "NOTES"

# mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sdxx <---- 1st/efi boot partition

set other partition same as on "NOTES"


====================
FLASHING IMAGE using DD:

dd bs=4M status=progress if=/Path to Image/2012-12-16-wheezy-raspbian.img of=/dev/sdd

dd if=FILE NAME HERE.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4MB status=progress  < ======= for ISOs

mount -o loop x.iso /mnt/iso <---- attaching iso

dd bs=4M if=./2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.img of=/dev/sdd & pid=$!
You can verify the process is still running throughout the copy with: pidof dd

Another option to monitor progress is to use Pipe Viewer (pv). Pipe dd input part through pv to the output part of dd:
dd bs=4M if=2014-09-09-wheezy-raspbian.img | pv | dd of=/dev/mmcblk0
2,02GB 0:06:34 [10,4MB/s] [       <=>                              ]
