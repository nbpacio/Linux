

Install with git :wrench:
Be sure you don’t have a directory ~/.nano and no file ~/.nanorc.

Then, clone the repository and symlink the config file:

git clone https://github.com/Naereen/nanorc.git ~/.nano/
ln -s ~/.nano/.nanorc ~/.nanorc
You can try to check if the installation went well by opening the ~/.nanorc file.

nano  ~/.nanorc  # should be nicely colored!
Warning: clearly, this will only work on GNU/Linux. And I only tested it on Ubuntu…




Install manually
You can download and install any of the LANGUAGEXXX.nanorc files, where you wish, and be sure that your ~/.nanorc file include the files you want, with this syntax:

# Coloration for nanorc, from https://github.com/Naereen/nanorc
include "~/.nano/nanorc.nanorc"
